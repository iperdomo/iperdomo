### Hi there :wave:

I usually work as a software architect, senior engineer, technical advisor, team lead, mentor.
Depending on the context.

Since 2001 I have played different roles on organizations of different sizes, from small family-own
companies, startups, to Fortune 500. I have worked with several technologies across my career
settling on the JVM and Web related technologies since 2006.
